    <main>Louis Litt has been involved in many memorable cases throughout *Suits*, but a few stand out as particularly significant or interesting in the web series, especially considering his growth as a lawyer and his personal stakes in each case. Here are a few of his top cases:

    <li> 1. **The Ava Hessington Case** (Season 3):
           This is one of Louis' most high-stakes and complex cases, where he takes on the defense of Ava Hessington, an oil executive accused of bribing foreign officials. It's a defining moment in Louis' career, and he proves himself as a skilled litigator. The case challenges him in new ways and shows that he can stand up to Harvey and other senior figures at the firm.</li>
        
        <li> 2. **The Donna Paulsen Lawsuit** (Season 4):
           Although it's more of a personal matter than a legal case, Louis represents Donna after she is sued by her former employer, and it brings his feelings for her into the spotlight. Louis, who has deep feelings for Donna, takes on the case personally and shows his loyalty to her, which is a key part of his character development.</li>
        
        <li> 3. **The Pearson Specter Merger Case** (Season 5):
           Louis plays a central role in the merger between Pearson Hardman and the rival firm, Pearson Specter. This case is notable not just because of its significance to the firm's future but because Louis has to balance his own ambition with the stability of the firm and his loyalty to his colleagues, especially Harvey.</li>
        
        <li>   4. **The SEC Investigation of Pearson Specter** (Season 6):
           In this season, Louis becomes more involved with the ongoing investigation into the firm. He faces the pressure of potentially going to jail due to his involvement in some shady deals from earlier seasons. It highlights his willingness to protect the firm, even when his own career and reputation are on the line.</li>
        
       <li> 5. **The Katrina Bennett Case** (Season 6-7):
           Louis mentors Katrina Bennett, and they work together on a case that involves a client facing significant legal trouble. It's a pivotal moment for Louis because it demonstrates his ability to lead and teach others, and his relationship with Katrina strengthens as she grows as a lawyer under his guidance.</li>
